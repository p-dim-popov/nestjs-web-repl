# nestjs-web-repl

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/pull/41) [`fe82376`](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/commit/fe82376bdbfa33016525ed28c52dc4ff4bc1156b) Thanks [@p-dim-popov](https://github.com/p-dim-popov)! - Publish through npm trusted publishing (OIDC) instead of an access token. No code changes: this release validates the trusted-publisher configuration for every package.
- Updated dependencies [[`fe82376`](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/commit/fe82376bdbfa33016525ed28c52dc4ff4bc1156b)]:

  - @remote-repl/redis@1.0.1

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/pull/35) [`c826981`](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/commit/c8269817f2d7d24dafe2ae5d53de0482babe22ee) Thanks [@p-dim-popov](https://github.com/p-dim-popov)! - `nestjs-web-repl` is now a compatibility shim over the `@remote-repl` packages ([#19](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/issues/19), [#36](https://github.com/p-dim-popov/remote-repl/issues/36)).
  
  The implementation moved to `@remote-repl/nestjs` (the NestJS module), `@remote-repl/redis` (the Redis transports), `@remote-repl/express` (the Express router) and `@remote-repl/core` (the engine and the protocol). Those four packages publish at 1.0.0 and carry their own version lines from here on; this package stays on its 2.x line and depends on `@remote-repl/nestjs ^1.0.0` and `@remote-repl/redis ^1.0.0`.
  
  Every name an app imported from `nestjs-web-repl` or `nestjs-web-repl/redis` still resolves, as a `@deprecated` alias of its replacement, and the new names are exported beside them. `WebReplModule.register` / `registerAsync` still accept the `adapter` extra (every DI form) and pass it on as `transport`. A transport that implements only `onModuleDestroy()` keeps working. There is no runtime warning.
  
  | `nestjs-web-repl` (deprecated) | replacement in `@remote-repl/nestjs` |
  | --- | --- |
  | `WebReplModule`, `register({ adapter })` | `RemoteReplModule`, `register({ transport })` |
  | `WebReplController` / `WebReplService` | `RemoteReplController` / `RemoteReplService` |
  | `InMemoryWebReplAdapter` | `RemoteReplInMemoryTransport` |
  | `WEB_REPL_OPTIONS` | `REMOTE_REPL_OPTIONS` |
  | `WebReplAdapter` (`onModuleDestroy`) | `RemoteReplTransport` (`close`) |
  | `WebReplModuleOptions` / `WebReplModuleExtras` / `WebReplAdapterConfig` | `RemoteReplModuleOptions` / `RemoteReplModuleExtras` / `RemoteReplTransportConfig` |
  | `WebReplEvent` / `SseEventType` | `RemoteReplEvent` / `RemoteReplSseEventType` |
  
  | `nestjs-web-repl/redis` (deprecated) | replacement in `@remote-repl/redis` |
  | --- | --- |
  | `IoRedisWebReplAdapter` / `NodeRedisWebReplAdapter` / `BaseRedisWebReplAdapter` | `RemoteReplIoRedisTransport` / `RemoteReplNodeRedisTransport` / `RemoteReplBaseRedisTransport` |
  | `RedisWebReplAdapterOptions`, `IoRedisLike`, `NodeRedisLike` | `RemoteReplRedisTransportOptions`, `RemoteReplIoRedisLike`, `RemoteReplNodeRedisLike` |
  
  **Wire change.** This version speaks the `remote-repl` wire protocol 1.0.0 (`PROTOCOL.md` in `@remote-repl/core`) and is not interoperable with 2.3.x on one Redis. During a rolling upgrade the old and the new instances form two clusters until the last 2.3.x instance stops; its leases then expire and no further repair is needed.
  
  **Removed.** The `npx nestjs-web-repl install-skill` bin. Install the agent skill with `npx skills add p-dim-popov/remote-repl/skills/nestjs-web-repl`.
  
  Why `minor`: every 2.3.x import and option still works. The wire change only matters for a mixed-version cluster during a rolling upgrade, which the protocol document covers.
  
  Why no changeset for the four `@remote-repl` packages: they have never been published. `changeset version` only bumps packages that have a pending changeset, so they stay at the 1.0.0 set by hand, and `changeset publish` publishes every workspace package whose current version is absent from the registry, so all four ship on the first release without a changeset or a changelog entry.
